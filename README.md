## üöÄ Project Explanation
This project primarily supports backtesting simulations and paper trading monitoring.
It retrieves daily trading data stored in AWS S3 through APIs, ensuring that the web application focuses solely on monitoring and visualization without performing direct trading or computation tasks.

The backend adopts a CI/CD-driven architecture, where pricing calculations and strategy computations are fully decoupled from the main service.
All data updates and validations are handled by a scheduler and CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the retrieval process remains efficient, consistent, and reliable.

This design enhances modularity, security, and performance, making the system highly suitable for daily trading supervision and quantitative strategy development environments.

For testing the S3 key (download daily Log file), please email: lukerspace@gmail.com 

### Clone the repository




```bash
1Ô∏è‚É£ download
Download from GitHub

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies by npm install
npm install


3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the development servers
npm run dev


Start the Flask backend on port 8000.
Start the Vite frontend on port 8081.
Enable CORS (flask_cors) so the frontend can communicate with the backend seamlessly.
